# Frappe Backend Application

This project is a small backend application built using the Frappe framework in Python. It showcases features like a Hooks System, CLI for Model Creation, Model Structure and Validation, and an API Endpoint to retrieve data based on model specifications.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**

   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Install Frappe using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install frappe
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/frappe-backend-app.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd frappe-backend-app
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Hooks System

   The application includes hooks that can be executed at specific events. Example hooks are provided in the `hooks.py` file.

### 2. CLI for Model Creation

   Create new models in the database using the CLI tool:

   ```bash
   python app.py create-model <ModelName>
   ```

   This command creates a new directory `models/<ModelName>` containing the model class and definition file.

### 3. Model Structure and Validation

   The application enforces table names to follow the pattern `tab<ModelName>`. Model properties and validations are defined in the corresponding JSON file (e.g., `User.json`).

### 4. API Endpoint

   The API endpoint allows you to retrieve data based on model specifications. Use the following endpoint:

   ```
   GET /api/retrieve-data?modelName=<ModelName>&fields=["field1", "field2"]&filters={"field": ["operator", "value"]}
   ```

## Examples

1. **Run the Application**

   Start the Frappe application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Execute Hooks**

   After starting the application, hooks will be executed based on the specified events.

3. **Create a Model**

   Use the CLI to create a new model:

   ```bash
   python app.py create-model User
   ```

   This creates the directory `models/User` with the necessary files.

4. **Retrieve Data**

   Use the API endpoint to retrieve data based on model specifications.

   Example:

   ```
   GET /api/retrieve-data?modelName=User&fields=["*"]&filters={"fullName": ["==", "David"], "createdAt": [">=", "1-1-2023"]}
   ```

CLI for Model Creation
To create a new model in the database, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py create-model <model_name>
Replace <model_name> with the desired name of the model. For example, to create a model named "User," run:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py create-model User
On execution, a new directory models/User will be created containing:

User.py: A Python class representing the model and extending a base Document class.
User.json: Model definition file, specifying field types and required fields.
Feel free to customize the structure of the model and its corresponding JSON file in the created directory.
